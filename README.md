To set up and run the application, first ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Next, install the required dependencies by running npm install. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running npm start or node server.js in the terminal. This will start the Express server on port 3000 by default.

In this application, I utilized Express.js to create a web server that handles various routes for rendering HTML views and processing form submissions. Middleware functions such as body-parser were used to parse incoming request bodies, allowing for easy access to form data. Additionally, I implemented a custom middleware function for logging request details to the console, providing insight into incoming requests. The application utilizes the EJS templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML views, allowing for the reuse of templates across different routes. Error handling is implemented to handle scenarios such as missing or invalid email inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience. Static files, such as CSS stylesheets and client-side JavaScript, are served from the public directory using Express's built-in express.static middleware. Lastly, a catch-all route is defined to handle invalid routes, responding with a 404 status code and a "Not Found" message. Overall, the application provides a robust and efficient solution for building a multi-page web application with Express.js and EJS templating.
