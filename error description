In the /submitFeedback route handler of the application, when the email field is missing or the email format is invalid, the server crashes without providing a meaningful error response. This abrupt behavior results in a poor user experience and makes it challenging to diagnose and resolve the issue efficiently.

To address this problem, proper error handling needs to be implemented in the /submitFeedback route handler. Instead of crashing the server, we should gracefully handle scenarios where the email field is missing or the email format is invalid. By providing appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request), we can inform the client of the nature of the problem.

During the resolution process, various tools and debug techniques can be employed. Logging statements can be used to understand the state of the application when the error occurs, while a debugger can help inspect variable values and execution flow to identify the root cause of the error. Additionally, error monitoring tools such as Sentry or New Relic can capture and track errors in production environments, facilitating proactive issue identification and resolution.
